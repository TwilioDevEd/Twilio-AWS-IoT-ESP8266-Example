The Twilio Send SMS/MMS Example requires the [Python Twilio Helper Library](https://www.twilio.com/docs/libraries/python).

This example also requires a few environmental variables from your [Twilio Console](https://twilio.com/console):

* AUTH_TOKEN
* ACCOUNT_SID

Merely create those in the Lambda console for this function and you should be ready.
